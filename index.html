							<p id="addinfotitle" class="rightp">
								Because nothing validates me more than talking about myself :)
							</p>
							<p id="addinfo" class="rightp">
								My hobbies include:
								<ul>
									<li>Studying Japanese</li>
									<li>Playing the piano (still far from being the best out there)</li>
									<li>Painting with acrylic paint when I'm in the mood to do so</li>
								</ul>

									My childhood dream was to be a pilot. I was always forced to say something 'masculine' for my parents' standards because I grew up a lot with my sisters and I was quite effeminate back then. I really wanted to be a professional volleyball athlete back then. I tried to reach that by being a volleyball player during my highschool years but I guess it's not really for me; however things turned out, I'm happy with where I'm at right now.

				<h3 class="qs">Favorite CMSC subject</h3>
					<p class="ans">
						My favorite CMSC subject as of now would be CMSC 22. It was difficult to learn new concepts, especially those of OOP, but I really enjoyed learning about it.
					</p>
				<h3 class="qs">Favorite GE</h3>
					<p class="ans">
						My favorite GE subject so far would be KAS 1 under Ma'am Beng Boro-Magbanua. Although it was cut short due to the pandemic, I had fun learning in her class, and I still have my KAS 1 notes. The class was a bit difficult, especially the quizzes make me nervous, and I had to reaaaaally put an effort into reviewing the past lessons. Nevertheless, I thought that Ma'am Beng was an amazing professor.
					</p>
				<h3 class="qs">Favorite programming language</h3>
					<p class="ans">
						My favorite language at the time being is Java, and Python. I think I really liked Python for its simplicity and readability. I learned that it can also be used for OOP so I tried learning it some OOP concepts with Python before my CMSC 22. When I started learning OOP with Java, I just loved the way things work, class relationships, abstraction, things like that. I got used to it so much at one point, I was putting semicolons at the end of my sentences when chatting with friends.

				<h3 class="qs">Favorite food</h3>
					<p class="ans">
						Sushi. Ramen. Japanese food. I love Ramen especially because it's easy to get full just by eating this noodle dish.
